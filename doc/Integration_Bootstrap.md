##Yii booster Bootstrap integration

First you need to dowload yiibootstrap theme. Then:

Put the folders "css" and "views" in a folder "bootstrap" in the themes folder.

The paths:
/themes/bootstrap
/themes/bootstrap/css
/themes/bootstrap/views

Then put the others folders in "extensions" 
The path:
/protected/extensions/[folders]

Now to configure the main.php (/protected/config/main.php) check the example in (doc/examples/bootrstrap_main.php).

Note that the layout is in the bootstrap folder.
